# Say we have a number of bank accounts, and we want to make some transfers between these accounts
# at the end of each day to make sure that each account will have at least 100 dollars after these transfers.
#
# Please write a program to implement this. Each transfer will be presented as a tuple of (from_account, to_account, amount).
#
# For example:
# bankAccounts = [("a", 80), ("b", 180), ("c", 90)]
# transfers = makeTransfers(bankAccounts)
# transfers = [("b", "a", 20), ("b", "c", 10)]
